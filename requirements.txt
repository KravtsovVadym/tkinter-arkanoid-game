# Tkinter is included with Python by default on Windows and macOS
# On Linux, you may need to install it separately:
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
# Arch: sudo pacman -S tk

# No additional packages required - game uses Python standard library only
